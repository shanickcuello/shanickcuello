### About me 

Software Engineer (TDD, Clean Code & a calling for Cybersecurity)

🧑🏼‍💻 /etc/passwd
- Tech recruiter at lemon.io
- Co-founded a tech startup at 18. We worked with the National Ministry of Education, UNESCO, and Microsoft.
- I work in English. Native in Spanish and C#. I speak fluent French and Python. Learning Norwegian for fun.
- I love leading retrospectives, postmortems, plannings, and other magical Scrum rituals.

I'm a Software Engineer with 8 years of experience, specialized in mobile and backend development.
I work primarily with C# and Unity 3D, and also with Python and Kali Linux. Depends the hour.

🏁 /etc/crontab
+ I make product decisions based on data and metrics. N-testing is my best friend.
+ I focus on what I can't delegate — high-impact work first, Hyperfocus style.
+ I help create safe and honest team environments. Big fan of Radical Candor.
+ I can’t split the bill, Never Split the Difference, Tahl Raz style.

I write code because I enjoy it. I build products because they motivate me. I hack systems to help make the world safer.
