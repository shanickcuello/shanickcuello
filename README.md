## 🌟 About Me

I'm a software engineer specialized in mobile development. With over 7 years of experience, I've honed my skills in **Mobile**, **Backend**, and **VideoGames** development. I'm passionate about solid patterns, **Test Driven Development (TDD)**, and **Domain Driven Design (DDD)** among other design patterns. 
I love hacking and actively practice on **Hack The Box**! Here are some of the skills and tools I enjoy using:
- 🛠️ **Nmap**
- 🔍 **Burp Suite**
- 🔒 **Metasploit**

But I'm not just a hacker/developer. I'm that spark of motivation for the team, always pushing to improve, optimize processes, and actively participate in the entire agile cycle. **Always learning, always growing!** 📈✨
